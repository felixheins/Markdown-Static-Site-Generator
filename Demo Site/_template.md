# Template File

This is a template file that starts with underscore. It should not appear in the navigation menu, but should still be accessible if you know the URL.

This file demonstrates the underscore feature where files starting with `_` are:
- Still converted to HTML
- Still accessible via direct URL
- But excluded from navigation menus

You can test this by visiting: `_template.html`
