# Sample Image File

This is a placeholder for an image file. In a real Obsidian vault, this would be an actual image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) that gets copied to the output directory for use in your pages.

Images can be referenced in markdown like:

![Image Description](Resources/sample-image.png)

or with Obsidian embed syntax:

![[sample-image.png]]
